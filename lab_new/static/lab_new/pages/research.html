            In 2010, we found the FFL (feed-forward loops) regulation modal between TF and miRNAs, which has the ability to clarify complex molecular mechanisms underlying diseases, such as Schizophrenia. Till now, FFL modal has been widely used, and expanded to FBL (feedback loops). For FFL, there are TF-FFL, miRNA-FFL, composite FFL, coherent FFL, incoherent FFL. For FBL, there are double-negative loop and single negative loop of it.

        <p style="font-family: Arial;text-align:justify; text-justify:distribute-all-lines;">
            We have applied our modal in leukemia and found two important regulation molecules including miR-146b regulating NUMB and miR-19/CYLD/NFKB FFL in occurrence and development of leukemia.

        <p>In bioinfomatics, the data always takes an important position, and there was a sharp increase of the amount of data in recent years. To make the best use of these resources and provide those useful information to researchers, we integrated those data info databases. Our database content is multifaceted, including TF databases; miRNA databases; lncRNA databases; disease databases; database related to gene regulation in disease; database related to eQTLs, please refer to the resource page for details.</p>

        <p>In addition, we are interest in coding tools to address bioinfomatics problems, such as the tool to find specific expressed genes in cancers; the tool to analyze a set of genes in cancers with the following functional modules; the tool to characterize and analyze the T cell receptor repertoire; the tools to predict abundance of T cell subtypes, please refer to the resource page for detail.</p>

        <hr class="divider">
        <p>Take advantage of public resources such as TCGA and ICGC which produces open-access genomic data about cancers, perform analyses of gene expression, gene mutation and methylation of DNA (which can lead to alterations in gene expression) and pathway analysis, we can get information about biological mechanisms of cancer development, key regulators in cancer and find biomarkers or drug targets in specific cancer. We also interest in the research of pan-cancer and cancer immunotherapy.</p>
